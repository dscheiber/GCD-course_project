Subjects: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. (Ortiz et al.)

Labels: Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. (Ortiz et al.)

Sub-sequent variables: Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. (Ortiz et al.) For each variable, the "average" value has been calculated per subject and activity, and displayed.

Study design:
Data was collected from provided test and training sets. The sets were merged and mean and standard deviation measurements were extracted. Each extracted measurement was averaged according to its subject and label. The final table presents each subject (n:30), with each activity (n:6), with each averaged measurement (n:66). The final dimensions are 180 x 68 (including subject and label columns.)
